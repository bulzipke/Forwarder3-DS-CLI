# Forwarder3-DS-CLI
Forwarder generator app for DS game forwarders on 3DS

I made it for personal use.

## Usage
1. Modify the flashcard template you will use in config.txt
2. Put the .nds files into the Games folder. It should be in the same format as "release_number - game name"
3. Update the title name that will appear in Forwarder to title.txt
4. run main.py
